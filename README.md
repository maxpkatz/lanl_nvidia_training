# NVIDIA HPC SDK Training (January 2022)

This repository contains the code examples that go along with the NVIDIA HPC SDK training session hosted by NERSC, OLCF, and ALCF (https://www.nersc.gov/users/training/events/nvidia-hpcsdk-training-jan2022/).

Each subdirectory has code examples for each of the different programming models presented at the training.

# Standard Language Parallelism

The `stdpar` directory contains examples of using Fortran standard language parallelism (`do concurrent`, math libraries, and related concepts) and C++17 standard language parallelism (`std::transform`, `std::for_each`, and related concepts).

# Directives

The `directives` directory contains examples using OpenMP and OpenACC.

# CUDA

The `cuda` directory contains CUDA C++ examples.
